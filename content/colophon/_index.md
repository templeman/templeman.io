This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open source static site
generator, and hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). The
CSS is written in SASS with the help of
[inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss), a beautifully unopinionated
OOCSS-based framework created by [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/about/).

The main body copy is rendered as Source Serif Pro. Headings are rendered as
Poppins, with the exception of the main page headings, which are rendered as
Intro.

Prototyping was done using Adobe Experience Design and pen+paper. Vectors
built with Illustrator.
