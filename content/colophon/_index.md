This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open source static site
generator, and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The CSS is
written in SASS with the help of
[inuitcss](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss), a beautifully unopinionated
OOCSS-based framework created by [Harry
Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/about/).

The main body copy is rendered as Source Serif Pro. Headings are rendered as
Poppins, with the exception of the main page headings, which are rendered as
Intro.

Prototyping was done using Adobe Experience Design and pen+paper. Vectors built
with Illustrator. Icons from BigMug and [The Noun
Project](https://thenounproject.com/).
