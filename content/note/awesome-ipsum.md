In the 1500's, an anonymous printer co-opted a body of text and scrambled it to
make a type specimen book. Eventually the passage that we now recognize as
Lorem Ipsum grew into the de facto standard for filler text used by typesetters
and designers the world over.

In the past decade, filler text has undergone somewhat of a renaissance. Back
in 2011 we got [Bacon Ipsum](https://baconipsum.com/), which showed the world
what filler text could be. Other variations quickly followed. Today we have
gone from one venerable standard to literally hundreds of cheeky filler text
flavors featuring everything from [zombies](http://www.zombieipsum.com/) to
[Nietzsche](http://nietzsche-ipsum.com/). In fact, anyone with a clever idea
and some basic programming skills can create an ipsum of their own, to the
point where it has become a kind of "Hello World" exercise for developers
wanting to experiment with Markov chains while giving a shout out to their
favorite [place](http://www.maineripsum.com/),
[celebrity](http://www.jbipsum.com/), or [television
show](http://heisenbergipsum.com/).

It's no surprise, then, that these lorem ipsum spin-offs come and go like the
wind. Those who celebrated the lovingly-crafted Lebowski Ipsum will be saddened
to find it gone now, a for-sale sign in its place.

Side-projects that they are, lorem ipsum spin-off sites spring up and fade out
with little fanfare, and keeping track of them is difficult. Many attempts
have been made to catalogue the various ipsum generators, but most of these end
up as outdated lists full of link-rot.

In a (perhaps futile) attempt to solve this problem, and more selfishly, as a
means of getting my feet wet in open source collaboration, I created [Awesome
Ipsum](https://github.com/templeman/awesome-ipsum). In keeping with the larger
[awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) trend on GitHub,
Awesome Ipsum strives to maintain an up-to-date listing of lorem ipsum
generators from around the web.

The generators are broken up by kind, then further categorized with tags
denoting any helpful features. Anyone is encouraged to peruse the list and
contribute new generators, or help notify me of decommissioned sites. By
soliciting help from the community, I hope to have a near-comprehensive list
with a minimum of link-rot. I've already received a number of great suggestions
and useful pull requests. Give it a look and - if you fancy revisiting it later
- a star as well.
