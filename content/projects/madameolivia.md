An older project, I began working on Madame Olivia in 2010 while studying at
the Art Institute of Portland. I partnered with a local writer to create an
application that would dynamically serve up “fortunes” – horoscope-like
passages tailored to each recipient. I designed the look and feel of the site
to compliment the Madame Olivia personality and voice. I also wrote the
algorithm for composing readings based on individual criteria as well as the
timing function for notifying subscribers whenever a new reading is made
available to them.

Eventually the application evolved to include a custom CMS facilitating the
adding and editing of passages, a blog where visitors can submit questions
directly to Madame Olivia herself, and a paid subscription tier with Stripe
integration for payment processing.
