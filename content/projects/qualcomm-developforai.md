Qualcomm was looking to generate interest within the development community upon
release of its new Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK (Software
Development Kit). They decided to host a contest soliciting ideas for AI
applications that could leverage the power of the new NPE SDK and the
Snapdragon processor. I worked with [PMG](https://www.thepmgco.com/) to draft
the technical specifications for the project and hone the UX for the contest
microsite.

Using the design provided by PMG, I built the microsite and all associated
functionality. Notable features include a database backend for storing contest
entry data, custom administrator dashboard for easy moderation of contest
entries, automated transactional email communication with entrants, and
on-the-fly processing of user-submitted images.
