While working as lead designer at [McClenahan Bruer](https://www.mcbru.com/), I
participated in a number of branding projects. One of these involved a complete
re-brand of local healthcare startup Scribes STAT. I created the new company
logo, internally referred to as "Empathetic E", and honed a fresh set of brand
colors. The company, renamed Essia Health as part of the rebrand, went on to be
acquired by ScribeAmerica in 2015.
