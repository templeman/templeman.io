      <p>I am a creative professional based in Portland, Oregon. I specialize in full-stack web design and development, but Iâ€™m at my best when I get to draw on my background in art to solve creative problems in whatever forms they take - everything from designing album covers to building email templates.</p>
      <p>In short, I live for A-Ha moments. That, and chocolate cereal.</p>
